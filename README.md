# dwAboutIt
Pet-Project combining my two favorite parts of computers into an interesting malware strain. 

I plan on making a virus (ransomware) strain of this for every OS as a fun way to test my skills :)
Currently working on Linux
Linux version of Tartarus - /Update

I don't condone using this for malicious purposes, as mentioned this is just a pet-project to test myself, and to show my friends lol

Thanks for coming to my TEDTALK :)
